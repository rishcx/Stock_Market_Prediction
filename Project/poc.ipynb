      "Elon Musk, CEO, Tesla, first disclosed the intention to reduce the companyâ€™s workforce by over 10 per cent on 15 April. Since then, multiple rounds of layoffs have been executed, with Musk reportedly aiming for a 20 per cent reduction in headcount. The latest round of layoffs will primarily impact workers at Tesla's Palo Alto and Fremont facilities. The termination process set to commence within a 14-day period starting 20 June, 2024, according to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) notice issued by Tesla. Last month, Tesla announced plans to cut 6,020 jobs in California and Texas as part of its broader downsizing strategy. The move also aligns with broader trends in the tech and automotive industries, where companies prioritise cost management and operational efficiency. For Tesla, maintaining market leadership requires a balance between innovation and financial prudence. The company says it is committed to being a leader in the electric-vehicle industry and will continue to innovate.\n"
