      " US Treasuries trimmed gains after the Federal Reserve reduced the number of projected interest-rate cuts this year to just one. The central bank is at odds with the market, leaving the central bank at odds. Bloomberg's most recent article was published by David Gergen.  Fed officials left their main policy-rate steady at a two-decade-high of 5.25% to 5.5% on Wednesday. They forecast only a single quarter-point cut by the end of the year. Still, Treasury yields rebounded slightly from their lowest levels of the session after the Fed communications.  Treasury yields remained lower by five to nine basis points in late trading after declining by at least 12 basis points. The median projection for the longer-run interest rate climbed to 2.8% from 2.6% in March. The idea that the so-called neutral rate is probably higher than pre-pandemic has been gaining currency.  Consumer prices were flat in May versus April, slowing the annual rate of inflation to 3.3% from 3.4%. The median estimates of economists in a Bloomberg survey were for a 0.1% monthly increase and no change in annual rate. Bond traders reverted to wagers on a reduction as early as September.  Fed officials’ median forecast for underlying inflation increased to 2.8% from from 2.6% in March. They maintained their forecasts for economic growth and unemployment rate at 2.1% and 4% respectively. The Fed has raised interest-rate rates in the past two years.

The world's most online male gymnast is preparing to compete in the Olympics.\n"
