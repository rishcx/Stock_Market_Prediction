    "news_texts=\"\"\"Giant stone head resembling an ancient Indigenous sculpture sits on top of a crushed Tesla car. Look what I do to your lousy car with this wonderful head. This is bigger than you and the rampant technologies, the sculptor says. A video released by the Colima 71 hotel shows the moment when the head was released and the car's roof gradually caved in. We wanted to preserve the magic and mystery of how it arrived, to let the work itself generate an impact and spark conversations, the hotel's artistic director says. It's the wonderful thing about art, it allows you these atrocities, says the 42-year-old sculptor. The head was inspired by the colossal head carvings of the Olmec, considered the first known major Mesoamerican civilization. The electric carmaker announced plans to build a huge factory in northern Mexico a year after announcing plans to sell cars in the U.S. and China.. The car's batteries had been removed before its roof was crushed.\n",

      " After a boom of interest in chipmaker Nvidia ‚Äî with shares logging an astronomical 200% rise over the last 12 months ‚Äî investors appear divided on whether to buy into the stock . One wealth manager, however, is happy not owning the chipmaker. \"I bought into Nvidia during early days and exited my position at a decent 300% gain. Of course, the stock has risen further to over $1,000 now, but I'm glad to have secured a profit at a price point I'm happy with,\" Dhruba Jyoti Sengupta told CNBC Pro earlier this month. The CEO of Wrise Private Middle East, which serves ultra-high-net-worth and high-net-worth individuals across Asia, the Middle East and Europe, said he likes three different stocks from around the world instead. Adobe Top of Sengupta's list is Adobe . After a tough time earlier in the year, the stock is seeing renewed interest following its second-quarter earnings which surpassed analysts' expectations. Shares in Adobe jumped by 17% after its results announcement last week, and are up around 7% in the last 12 months. Sengupta sees promise in the software company given the potential of generative AI not just for text, but also photos in the medium to longer-term. \"The market is not seeing much potential in Adobe because Nvidia is making all these big future predictions and markets love that. But Adobe offers a great opportunity being the biggest software company for photos,\" he added. According to FactSet data, of 43 analysts covering the stock, 34 give it a buy or overweight rating, 7 have hold ratings while two have a sell call. Their average price target is $611.20, giving it 16.3% potential upside. Harley-Davidson In the luxury goods space, Sengupta has his eye on Harley Davidson . \"Living in Dubai, I am a firm believer that no matter what happens, the luxury stocks in the long run will always do well ... Men are now becoming like women in terms of the luxury spends, especially on toys like Harley Davidson,\" he said. Shares in the iconic motorcycle manufacturer are down nearly 6% over the last 12 months, but Sengupta says the stock is undervalued, making it a good time to buy. Of 17 analysts covering Harley-Davidson, 8 give it a buy or overweight rating, while 9 have a hold rating at an average price of $42.96, according to FactSet data. This gives it upside potential of 32.1%. HDFC Bank In India, the wealth manager is betting on financial firm HDFC , as the country ‚Äî and the bank itself ‚Äî prepares for growth. \"The bank has a hugely diversified revenue stream. I think [it's] the most valuable bank in the world right now,\" he said. When asked how HDFC compares with competitors like ICICI Bank , Sengupta responded that the former's management is \"very stable with consistent leadership and that puts them in good standing.\" HDFC trades on India's National Stock Exchange and the BSE, and as an ADR in the U.S. Its shares are also included in the Nifty India Financials ETF (15.6% weight) and iShares India 50 ETF (11.2%). Shares in the bank are up by just over 1% in the last 12 months, but are showing signs of picking up. Of 43 analysts covering HDFC Bank on FactSet, 38 have a buy or overweight rating on the stock at an average price target of 1,872.32 Indian rupees ($22.41), giving it upside potential of 17.2%.\n",
