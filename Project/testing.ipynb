    "Tesla confirmed it had been eclipsed by Chinese rival BYD in the final months of 2023 for the first time ever in a quarter. On Monday, the Shenzhen-based carmaker reported December figures showing it finished the fourth quarter with a record 526,400 EVs sold. With BYD delivering 1.59 million fully electric vehicles in 2023, a 73% gain over the previous one, it could easily eclipse Tesla on a full-year basis this year. Management at Tesla recently admitted it is entering a period of slower growth. Much will hinge on the success of its upcoming $25,000 entry model, which Musk has said is “quite far advanced” in its development. Neither production nor sales figures for the Cybertruck were broken out, suggesting volumes are still thin for the moment following its long-anticipated launch last month. Shares in Tesla trended flat in early trading on Tuesday. The Warren Buffett–backed company just announced around Christmas plans to build its first-ever factory in Europe, a signal that it remains firmly focused on growth.\n",
